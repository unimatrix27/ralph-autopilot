/**
 * Admission (CONTEXT: eligibility gate). The single decision of *which open
 * issues to launch this tick, and in what order*. One deep module behind one
 * call — {@link admit} — that folds together the three concerns the pickup
 * decision used to be sliced across:
 *
 *   1. the pure label gate (OPEN + `ready-for-agent` + `afk` + not `hitl` +
 *      not paused + not a `[log]` issue + carries a `mode:*` + every
 *      `## Blocked by #n` dependency satisfied) — the {@link gateOne} seam, also
 *      shared by the moding/backlog synthetic-mode gate so they never re-implement it;
 *   2. the in-flight / active-run exclusions — an issue already running, or held
 *      by a still-active run row, is not admittable (a terminal `agent-stuck` /
 *      `merged` row does NOT hold it — re-labelling re-admits it for a fresh run;
 *      eligibility is from GitHub labels, never SQLite presence — ADR-0003);
 *   3. the scheduling order + slot fill (FIFO by issue age, `priority/*` label
 *      tie-break, issue number) capped at the caller's open-slot count.
 *
 * The caller injects everything `admit` needs through {@link World}: the
 * in-flight test, the run lookup, the GitHub dependency port, the open-slot
 * count (computed by the reconciler after resumes consume their slots), and the
 * operator's priority ordering. `admit` owns the per-tick dependency cache, so
 * the cache is exercised through this interface — not re-formed in the caller.
